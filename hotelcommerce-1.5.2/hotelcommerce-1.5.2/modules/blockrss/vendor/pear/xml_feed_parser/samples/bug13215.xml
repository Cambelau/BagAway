				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Pro Rentals Inc. owner Demetrios Prokos said yesterday he would abandon the plan to build a strip club on Stimson Avenue if city officials seem favorable to other plans for the building he owns there.   	Prokos submitted new designs to city code enforcement Tuesday for the former New-to-You thrift shop property at 9, 11 and 13 W. Stimson Ave. Those designs include apartments above four stores and a restaurant with a drive-thru window as well as additional apartments on the ground floor.	Code Enforcement Director Steve Pierson presented the new plans to the Athens Planning Commission yesterday.	The project, deemed a Planned Unit Development, will require several code exceptions for the height of the building and the number of available parking spots, Pierson said. A PUD goes through a more extensive review. City codes also do not permit first-floor apartments and serving alcohol on the property, he added. 	Athens City Council ultimately decides on whether to grant exceptions to city codes. 	In a prior interview, Prokos said providing three cars that residents can share and pay for by the hour will reduce the need for more parking, 	Prokos and the planning commission will meet March 20 to talk about necessary code exceptions for the plans. After the meeting, Prokos can submit an application and additional information to city council. Two public hearings will follow. 	If exceptions are approved after the hearings, Prokos will have one year to start the project, Pierson said. 	A used luxury auto dealership was already approved for part of the location but is not part of the new drawings. 	The Athens Board of Zoning Appeals will meet March 11 to decide if the strip club, which tentatively has been named The Hocking Valley Ladies’ and Gentlemen’s Club, is a permissible use of the Stimson Avenue property, Prokos said. 	“We’re ready to take it to the courts (if the strip club is denied),” Prokos said.</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The Scripps College of Communication will receive a $7.5 million donation before the end of this quarter, said Dean Greg Shepherd.  	A graduate of the college who has declined to be identified gave the endowment. The donor might reveal his or her name before the end of Winter Quarter, Shepherd said.	“It’s been a long-term project to secure this commitment, but it’s a wonderful thing for the college,” he said, adding that the gift might be the largest single donation given by a living individual to the university.	The money will be used to help support renovations to the Former Baker University Center, which will become the main building for the college. 	The total cost of renovating Former Baker, Scripps Hall and the Radio-Television Building — a long-term project to upgrade the college — is about $35 million. More than $30 million of that estimated cost will go toward construction to Former Baker. 	Capital appropriations will account for $21 million of the project. Sources for the rest of the cost are not yet determined.	The project, which is still in preliminary stages, should begin construction in January 2010 and should be completed by the fall of 2012, Shepherd said. 	Plans for the new building were unveiled in February 2006 and include connecting Former Baker with the R-TV building.The new name of Former Baker will “almost certainly be tied” to the donor, Shepherd said.	“We’ll definitely let the name be known,” he said. “We’ll make a big deal out of this.”</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Ohio University is considering covering damages to student property caused by sprinkler systems activated during a fire in Bromley Hall Wednesday afternoon.	In a letter sent to Bromley Hall residents yesterday, OU President Roderick McDavis said a review will be conducted to evaluate claims for reimbursement of damaged items. 	The university does not carry fire or other hazard insurance on students’ personal property, but McDavis advised that homeowner or renter insurance policies could cover the damages. 	The review will focus mainly on students without insurance, or “hardship cases,” said Kent Smith, vice president for Student Affairs, adding that students should check with insurance carriers first. 	“(President McDavis) is concerned with students not having insurance; he didn’t want to have students left out in the cold,” he said.	The sprinkler system activated during a fire in a sixth-floor room. Several rooms on the sixth floor were flooded with about an inch of water, which trickled down as far as the basement in some areas. 	“The system worked as designed to both signal warning of the fire and suppress it,” according to the letter.     	The review is still in preliminary stages and nothing has been made official, Smith said. It will be handled by staff in the Vice President of Student Affairs office and should begin next week. 	“Property damaged by fire or water can be replaced,” McDavis said. “You, our students, cannot be replaced.”

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The former Ohio University graduate student accused of murdering his father will undergo yet another mental evaluation, this time to determine if he was sane at the time his father was killed.	Jonathan Bebb, 32, will be examined by doctors from the Shawnee Forensic Center in Portsmouth by the order of Athens County Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Ward. This comes after Bebb’s attorneys filed a motion Monday asking to plead not guilty by reason of insanity. 	Bebb initially pleaded not guilty to aggravated murder Nov. 27 after being charged with killing his father, former OU history professor Phillip Bebb. Although Bebb has undergone other evaluations to determine if he was able to stand trial, this is the first evaluation to determine whether he was aware of his actions during the crime, said C. David Warren, Athens County prosecutor.    	Ward will decide later on whether the trial should be moved outside of Athens County, agreeing with Warren that it would be impossible to tell if there is a bias until jury selection begins. Kort Gatterdam, one of Bebb’s attorneys, has argued that extensive coverage of the case has created a “presumed prejudice.”  	But Ward did grant a request that no representatives of the prosecutor’s office or jail employees try to talk with Bebb while he’s incarcerated at Southeastern Ohio Regional Jail. This is a precautionary motion to secure Bebb’s constitutional rights, Gatterdam said.	“(Bebb) does not wish to speak to anyone about the case,” he said.	Prosecutors and Bebb’s lawyers will reach a decision on which photographs of the elder Bebb’s body will be allowed in court sometime before the trial begins. Prosecutors will inform Bebb’s attorneys what photos they intend to use in trial, and they will revisit the issue then, Warren said.	A final trial date will be selected during a pre-trial hearing on April 28.</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Dorothy Gamble knows this Sunday will be hard.	It was a Sunday morning five years ago when her son, former Ohio University student Terris Ross, was murdered. To this day, there have been no charges pressed.  	Ross, 23, was shot and killed March 9, 2003, in the parking lot of the University Commons apartment complex. 	Investigators from the Athens Police Department have followed up on every small lead they have gotten and need one small piece of information to finish the case, said Lt. John Withers, chief investigator of the case.  It is frustrating because many sources have not been cooperative, he said. 	Because this is an ongoing investigation, Withers could not provide any suspect names. However, in State v. Lanning in the  Ohio Court of Appeals, Withers testified that Brad McClain was a suspect in the case because the last call made from Ross’ cell phone before the murder was to McClain, according to court documents on an unrelated charge.  	Police spoke with a source as recently as 10 days ago, Withers said. Many people involved in the case have kept in touch and APD knows the whereabouts of others, he said.	Athens County Prosecutor C. David Warren said he will not try the case until there is sufficient evidence because the killer could go free if he or she is not convicted. 	Although they want the killer to be brought to justice, members of Ross’ family agree that it is necessary to wait for all of the evidence. 	“It’s frustrating (to wait for the prosecution), but I want the right person to be held accountable for killing Terris, my son, and I really don’t want to take him all the way to court and lose the case,” Gamble said. 	Angel Ross was engaged to Terris Ross and legally took his last name after his death. Their daughter, Teaira, was born three months after his death.     	As an adult and a reporter, Angel Ross said she knows the investigators need to “have all their ducks in a row” before the suspect is tried, but on an emotional level she wants the killer to be brought to justice. Ross works for The Mansfield News Journal. 	“My daughter has been my rock through all of this,” said Angel Ross of her 4-and-a-half-year-old daughter.   “She’s a smart little girl because both her mom and dad were OU graduates,” she said.  	She has explained to Teaira that “a bad person” killed her father, Angel Ross said.  	“I want her to know that this guy was caught.  That’s how it is supposed to work,” she said.	Athens County Democratic Party Chair Susan Gwinn used the Terris Ross case in campaign ads against Warren in the Athens County prosecutor’s race. The ads criticized how long it has taken Warren to prosecute on the case.  	“No prosecutor can charge anyone on what they know.  They have to charge on what they can prove,” Warren said 
in response to the advertisement. 	Anyone with information on the Terris Ross case should contact the Athens Police Department at 592-3315.</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> While momentum may not mean everything, the Bobcats are acutely aware that the last thing they want to do is limp into next week’s Mid-American Conference Tournament the losers of three straight.   	Winning Sunday’s regular season finale against Buffalo in The Convo would guarantee the fourth seed and final bye in the tournament, but the Bobcats hope it could also help them get back to the style of play that enabled them to have a five-game winning streak in late January.	“We definitely don’t want to lose again going into the tournament,” guard Bert Whittington IV said. “Everything’s not clicking right now with the team. It’s not chemistry but more that our overall game is just not there right now. I’m sure we’ll get back to it, though.”	Ohio (18-11, 8-7 MAC) has lost five of the eight games since that winning streak, and has seemed to lose the consistency that had made the team successful before. There were games where the stalwart defensive play that had become a trademark early on faltered at inopportune times and, at Kent State and against Akron, proved unable to stop an opponent.	There were offensive droughts, like at Miami and at Eastern Michigan, when the Bobcats failed to have any player score in double digits and slow starts that at home led to dramatic comebacks against Bowling Green and George Mason. What it all signals isn’t any great mystery either, forward Jerome Tillman said, Ohio has to find its consistency once again.	“It’s just all the little stuff that we were focused on in the beginning that we have to get back to,” Tillman said. “On defense, we need to contest more shots and not let teams do whatever they want. Guys have to make better reads sometimes ... make the smart plays instead of the glamorous plays. If we’re down, we have to know that we can’t get it all back in one play, we’ve just got to chip away at it.”	Both Tillman and Whittington said that teams have found ways to close in on Ohio’s offense as the season has progressed, making it harder for the Bobcats to get the ball to the post and getting in their passing lanes. But neither thought it was something the Bobcats couldn’t remedy. 	In the past eight games, the seven Bobcats who see the greatest amount of playing time have shot a combined 41.5 percent (145-of-342) from the field. It’s not horrible, but not as good as the team might like for the amount of shots they’re taking.	“I think a big thing is our shot selection,” Whittington said. “We need to move the ball around more because it’s been stagnant a little bit with everybody standing around just waiting for Leon (Williams) to get the ball inside instead of getting in there and everybody moving and getting good shots off.”	And there’s no better time for Ohio to make the switch back to consistency than Sunday against the Bulls, Whittington said.	“We just have to get focused and motivated again.”</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Ohio has faced some tough challenges this season, but none are more difficult than the one they face now. Not only do the Bobcats have to get over a crucial loss to Miami in which they lost their bye, they also have to attempt to do something that has never been done before.   	Nobody said it was easy	Since the Mid-American Conference moved its tournament to the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, no team that has failed to get a bye has won the tournament.But there have been some close calls.Buffalo made it to the finals in 2005 as the seven-seed. Toledo made it in 2006 also as a seven-seed. Miami made it in 2000 as the nine-seed and again in 2001 without a bye. 	We Meet Again	Earlier this season the Bobcats took on the Chippewas in Mount Pleasant, Mich., and won 71-64.Lauren Kohn led Ohio with 22 points and four steals.	Scouting the Chippewas 	Central Michigan is just 6-22 (2-13 MAC) on the season and is riding a four-game losing streak. The Chippewas are 2-8 against the Bobcats in their last 10 meetings. They are the worst defensive team in the league, giving up an average of 74.5 points per game. Their minus-8.1 scoring margin is second worst in the league.One of the key factors in the game will be if Ohio can limit its turnovers. Turnovers proved costly in its last game of the season against Miami, which the Bobcats lost 82-72 in overtime. Central Michigan is No. 2 in the conference in steals per game at 10.21. Ohio averages 19 turnovers a game, which is fourth worst in the MAC.Britni Houghton is just a sophomore, but she is already Central Michigan’s best player. Houghton is the team’s leading scorer at 12.8 points per game and second on the team in rebounds with 5.8 a game. 	Deja vu All Over Again	 Last year as the East Division’s third seed, Ohio faced the sixth seed from the West Division, Central Michigan, in the first round of the tournament and won 55-51.In fact, this will be the fourth straight season that the Bobcats have played Central Michigan in the first round. Ohio has won the previous three. In 2006 and 2007 after beating the Chippewas, the Bobcats went on to suffer a loss at the hands of Eastern Michigan. If Ohio wins on Sunday they play, you guessed it, Eastern Michigan, which is the No. 2 seed in the West Division. 	Ohio in the tournament	The Bobcats are just 9-18 in the Mid-American Conference tournament since it began in 1982-83. The one and only time that the Bobcats have won the whole thing was in 1986 when they beat Central Michigan, 92-85, in overtime. 	Also on Sunday	West Division number three seed Western Michigan takes on the sixth seed from the East, Akron, at 9 p.m.</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> With the most important   tournament of  the season approaching, Jacob Ison and his teammates have responded by becoming more vocal and energetic in the practice room.	And without the traditional seniors and juniors to lead the Bobcats into the Mid-American Conference Championships this weekend at Kent State, Ison and others are taking a leadership role to prepare the youthful squad for its biggest test yet.	Although Ison is often the loudest at end-of-practice sprints, he said the increased intensity has been a group effort.	“All the older guys are stepping up, and there are some younger guys who like to make themselves known,” the 174-pound sophomore said. “Everybody pushes each other. I don’t think there’s individually one person that stands out.”
For Ison and company, the weekend’s stakes couldn’t be higher.	The best performers at the tournament will have  an opportunity to advance to the NCAA Championships on March 20. The winners of the 10 weight divisions will receive automatic bids, leaving nine spots to be filled at-large. If none of the Bobcats earn a spot, then the entire team’s season could end this weekend.	But Ison said he feels the Bobcats are ready to prove what they are capable of.	“We’re just now starting to put things together,” he said. “I know we’ve been saying that all year, but I think we’ve got some kids who are on their way.”	Because of the tournament’s importance, the preparations have varied from the regular season’s schedule.	During the course of the season, the wrestlers rarely get an opportunity to scout the individual wrestler that they were to face for dual meets or invitationals. For the conference tournament, however, Ohio coach Joel Greenlee has been running film sessions to give his team an edge.	Another part of the process is easing up the team’s workouts. In January and February, Greenlee would pause only 30 seconds between drills, but now the time has increased to 45 seconds since Ohio’s last dual meet two weeks ago. The wrestlers have to be well-rested for today if they’re going to perform at their best, Greenlee said.	“Your body gets worn down, and now you’re trying to build it back up,” he said. “You’re able to wrestle a little bit harder.”	Even with the increased intensity and preparation, expectations are still modest among the Bobcats. After all, none of the wrestlers is projected to win their weight divisions.

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Ohio will square off against a tough UNC Greensboro team in a three-game series this weekend.      	“Greensboro will be as good, if not tougher, than the teams we’ve faced so far,” junior pitcher Chris Rigo said.	The Bobcats enter the weekend’s series on a three-game losing streak, which they calculated 10 total errors to their opponents five. The team has posted a 3-0 record without errors, and defense should be pivotal this weekend, senior shortstop Zach Hartle said.  	“Anytime you can play the game error free, it makes it easier on yourself,” Hartle said. “That’s one of our main focuses every time we hit the field practice or game.”	The Spartans (5-2) just snapped a four-game winning streak. They still pose a strong threat, however, as they hold a team batting average of .329 and have hit seven home runs.  	Ohio’s pitching staff has been solid this year, though, with a team ERA of 3.98 compared to their opponents 4.64.  	“On the mound we need to throw strikes, get ahead of hitters, keep them off balance, and keep them off the base paths,” Rigo said. 	Rigo has tallied 13 strikeouts in 13 and 2/3 innings of work.  	“Having a good strikeout ratio is important because it can help you pitch out of jams and can take the ball out of play, thus helping out the defense,” Rigo said.	Quality starts into the later innings will also be crucial. 	“If we can have starters go six to seven innings per start with minimal runs given up, it gives our team a very good chance at winning and helps the bullpen stay fresh,” Rigo said.	One of the keys to the weekend’s series will be to silence the Spartans’ bats early and jump out to an early lead. Greensboro is 3-1 when scoring in the first inning and 3-0 with a lead after the sixth.	“If we play solid through our lineup and our pitching is effective we will be able to win two to three games at Greensboro,” Rigo said.</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> For Ohio University varsity swimmer Carine Souza, experiencing the thrill of cheering fans and teammates was something she had never known in Brazil.  	“Here, fans get crazy for all sports. I was fascinated at the basketball game with the band and all that support. In Brazil, people are so big in soccer that they don’t care about anything else and don’t give any incentive for swimming,” Souza said.	Souza is part of the 5 percent of female varsity athletes at OU who bring an international perspective to their sports — a perspective that is highlighted by the celebration of International Women’s Day tomorrow.	Because of the lack of popularity of women’s sports in other countries, female athletes are often surprised by the opportunities in their sports and by the level of support for their teams while in the United States.	In many countries, state education systems do not advocate organized sports like the United States does with physical education in public schools. Although men and women are moving toward equality in many areas, athletics remains highly separated by gender, said Saumya Pant, visiting professor in Women’s Studies.	“In South Africa, everything sport revolves around men. Women are in the background,” said Louzeth Schutte, a freshman field hockey player from Free State, South Africa.	In Canada, diving isn’t offered at the collegiate level, so Saskatchewan native Lindsay Hamilton explored her options in the United States, and after talking with diving coach Russ Dekker, decided to come to OU.	“Back home, swimming and diving are completely separate. Here we (divers) cheer for the swimmers and really get to know them,” said Hamilton.	For Schutte, field hockey is the same to her here as in South Africa.	“I feel like it’s the same and basically comes down to the same thing, even though field hockey is not as widespread in high schools here like it is in South Africa,” Schutte said.	When Souza had to choose between swimming for OU or Brazil’s national swim team, she chose what she thought was the best option for success. 	Swimming at OU was a difficult choice because she knew she would have to compete and focus on her studies while living in a country where she didn’t speak the language. Her father communicated with OU staff because he was the only one in her family who knew English.	“I had to give up a little and stop swimming in Brazil,” said Souza, a junior dietetics major from Rio de Janeiro.	To an American, it’s surprising that someone would choose academic success over athletics, because in the United States it is possible to play professional sports — even for women — and be fairly well-paid, Pant said.	A fraction of international students have used sports to make it to U.S. universities, but most, especially women, plan to stop competing after college.	“If I graduate and get a degree in the U.S., I almost for sure can get a good job in Brazil,” said Souza.	Hamilton said that she might continue diving after college for a year or two, but will probably be done when she graduates.	Even though many female athletes don’t plan to continue competing after graduation, they maintain that sport is definitely a source of opportunity.	“Everything I got in my life is because of swimming,” Souza said. “I’ve learned another language, am going to school in the U.S. and meeting all of these new people.”</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> As energy efficiency remains a hot topic on the current environmental and political agenda, Ohio University is getting students involved in the effort.  	Sonia Marcus, OU’s sustainability coordinator, said the university is trying to get students to change their behavior to be more energy conservative through educational competitions such as the ResChallenge. The seven-week energy conservation competition between participating residence halls on each green tracks each residence hall’s weekly energy consumption. 	In the past, the competition also included water consumption, but the Office of Sustainability cannot monitor water consumption this year because several campus water meters are not working.	Water meters at Scott Quad, Martzolff House and Jefferson Hall are currently out of operation. Ron Chapman, director of energy management, said the university has notified the city of Athens about the dysfunctional meters and are waiting for them to be fixed.	Athens Water Maintenance Supervisor Nick Joseph was unavailable for comment at press time. 	Water bills for the residence halls are being calculated based on past water usage, Chapman said.	“They are able to estimate with some reasonability based on previous water bills,” Chapman said, adding that in a city such as Athens with many utilities, it’s not uncommon for several utilities to need attention at any given time.	“Even though water isn’t being counted as part of the competition, we are still reading the working meters … and still trying to encourage students to conserve water,” Chapman said.	Marcus explained OU’s energy consumption is determined by a variety of factors, such as the amount of utilities in use per building, how long each utility is in use and the square footage of each building.	“It’s tough to say how much progress is going on because energy conservation goes hand in hand with how people use the buildings,” Marcus said. 	With new technology creating a larger demand for energy, students are consuming more energy on average than in previous years.	“More students are bringing more electrical-dependent things per room,” Marcus said. “Students today have a different culture of consumption.”	According to Ohio University’s Performance Contract last updated in February 2007, the university has spent a total of $8,986,058 over the last five years in energy conserving infrastructure projects with a total cost savings of $7,055,617 as a result of these projects. 	“We may not have made a considerable monetary savings, but imagine what our energy expenditures would be like had we not completed the conservation projects,” Marcus said. 	Conservation projects such as the ResChallenge have been successful in both conserving energy and educating students about the need to conserve. 	Residents from the hall that saves the most will win an all expenses paid trip to Cedar Point on May 11. At the end of the sixth week of competition on March 1, Tiffin Hall held the lead on East Green, Frenzel House was No. 1 on South Green and James Hall was the frontrunner on West Green.	Harry Wyatt, executive director of Facilities Management, said the amount of energy savings during the competition thus far is clearly higher than the savings last year.	“I’m very proud of the way students are reacting,” he said.</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Two Ohio University students had a bright idea about reducing energy consumption in residence halls — install energy-efficient light bulbs. 	Aaron Lemley, a sophomore from Bromley Hall, and Beth Ellis, a graduate student from Adams Hall, recently requested energy-efficient light bulbs from the Office of Sustainability in conjunction with the ResChallenge energy conservation project. 	OU Sustainability Coordinator Sonia Marcus provided each student with 50 compact fluorescent light bulbs to distribute to residents in their respective residence halls in exchange for incandescent light bulbs. The bulbs are used in personal lighting fixtures such as desk lamps. Marcus said her department is able to supply a maximum of 50 bulbs per student request. 	The 20-watt compact fluorescent light bulbs have the ability to produce the same amount of light as a 75-watt incandescent bulb, Marcus said. 	“One compact fluorescent bulb probably saves $20 to $30 over its lifetime,” she said. “The bulbs not only generate high-quality lighting but also last longer with most having a nine-year warranty.”	Lemley distributed the light bulbs along with information about energy conservation and said 50 bulbs were not enough to accommodate Bromley. 	“There are definitely a lot of people that could still use them,” Lemley explained. He said that residence hall energy conservation efforts would have a greater impact if more funding and resources were available. 	Ellis agreed and said she has noticed a change in residents’ energy consumption behavior since the start of the competition but believes more of an effort is needed.	“Hall Council can only do so much,” she said. 	Ellis said Adams Hall divided the 50 light bulbs among the building’s four floors. She explained that with Adams being such a new residence hall, it’s harder for residents to compete in the Residence Challenge because the building is already so energy-efficient.	Harry Wyatt, executive director of Facilities Management, explained that Adams has an interesting balance between energy efficiency and energy consumption. 	“Adams is certainly a modern building, but it is also built to accommodate more modern energy features and with that comes greater energy usage,” Wyatt said.	Wyatt said that residence hall energy efficiency and consumption varies across the board depending on each building and its renovations.	Jneanne Hacker, associate director of Housing, praised the students’ conservation efforts. 	“The new light bulbs are making a huge difference not only in lighting but in energy savings as well,” she said.</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The Project ReUse fashion show isn’t exactly part of New York fashion week, but this year, armed with a celebrity judge and a new location, ReUse Industries plans to show that recycling can be more than just practical — it can be fashionable.    	Saturday’s fashion show at ARTS/West will show off the creations of nine teams of designers. The $6 admission will benefit ReUse Industries, a non-profit environmental organization whose main goal is to keep reusable materials from being dumped into the waste stream. 	The designing teams were given $10 each in the form of a gift card to the ReUse Thrift Store and about a month to make their creations. They will compete for gift baskets full of $500 worth of prizes donated by local businesses. 	Judging the designs will be Passion Works founder Patty Mitchell, local musician Liz Pahl and former Project Runway semi-finalist Angela Kesler.	Sherri Oliver of ReUse Industries organized the show and said she contacted Kesler about becoming a judge when she found out she was from Amesville, Ohio —   about 20 minutes from Athens. 	“She is someone from the fashion world who is local and very involved in the Athens community, and we are really excited to have her,” Oliver said.	Kesler isn’t the only surprise that ReUse Industries has up its sleeve. The after-party, which will be at Casa Cantina, will feature the bands Casual Future, Silo Circuit and Russenorsk. The show will start at 10:30 p.m. and run until 1 a.m., when the bars close early for daylight saving time.	Those who can’t make the show will still be able to see the outfits, Oliver said. They will be displayed at Stuart’s Opera House in Nelsonville April 25 at the opera house’s Final Fridays gallery. 	“The whole purpose of the event is just to show people that you don’t have to spend tons of money, or even buy something new to come up with something really interesting and fashion forward,” Oliver said.</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Semi-Pro is what you get when you cross Anchorman, a sports movie and a plethora of jokes about balls. The new Will Ferrell comedy tries to slam dunk with laughs, but most of the jokes miss the net.    	Ferrell plays Jackie Moon, the head coach, owner and forward for the Flint, Michigan Tropics, an ABA basketball team in 1976. The league is about merge with the NBA, and Jackie is promised that if his struggling team gets into the top four, it will move to the new league. Moon’s secret weapon is Monix (Woody Harrelson), a washed-up, former Celtics player.	If you cannot tell by now, this is the same plot as every other sports movie. The team has to come together to win and so on and so forth, so just forget the plot. The jokes are the reason people will be crowding the theaters to see this sports spoof. Many of them will be disappointed. 	In its favor, Semi-Pro is a thousand times better than The Comebacks, the sports comedy released earlier this year. Ironically, David Koechner, the star of The Comebacks, plays the villain in Semi-Pro like he is trying to redeem himself for past sins. 	There is one laugh-out-loud, hilarious scene in the movie, though. Ferrell, Tim Meadows, Will Arnett and Andy Richter are sitting around a table playing poker. Arnett pulls out a pistol and an impromptu game of Russian roulette begins. It is obviously hard to imagine a suicidal game of chance being comedy gold, but it is the movie’s pinnacle. 	For some reason the movie is incredibly schizophrenic. It can’t decide if it wants to be funny or serious. There are several dramatic scenes with Monix trying to get back together with an old flame and motivating the team. This is supposed to be a comedy. Watching Harrelson act is like finding a musical number during the middle of No Country for Old Men. It does not fit at all. 	The rest of the movie is not much more than a slightly warmed rehash of Anchorman. There is a bear fight, lots of absurd exclamations and Ferrell singing.  	Ferrell is starting to make a career out of bad sports movies. First there was Talladega Nights, then Blades of Glory and now this. If he tries long enough, he will have to get things right eventually. Honestly, it is not surprising that this movie is not funny. Movies that are as over-advertised as Semi-Pro are usually proportionately bad. 	The Landlord proves that Ferrell can still be funny, but Semi-Pro is a complete air ball. Ferrell is trying too hard to regain past glory. There is no doubt that he is still talented, but Semi-Pro is a foul.</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Finally. Good, pure music has been in short supply for at least the last few weeks. Thankfully, that streak ended this week. 	With the release of The Black Crowes’ Warpaint, listeners get a reprieve. It’s been seven years since we’ve heard a new studio album from them.  It’s been way too long. 	Warpaint shows off the Crowes’ southern roots and is as comforting to hear as a lot of southern food can be to eat. 	There is a mixture of country, rock and the blues that puts a new spin on songs that could have been sung during the Civil War. 	Lead singer Chris Robinson’s gritty vocals fit perfectly with the gospel sound of “God’s Got It” and the heavy blues riffs of “Walk Believer Walk.” Although Robinson’s vocals have always been hard-edged, they soften surprisingly well, expressing all the intended sensitivity of “There’s Gold in Them Hills.”	But Robinson’s lyrics are not the only thing going on in this album. For once this season, there is more than just strumming behind the vocals. The guitar takes on a life of its own, almost creating a secondary voice behind the singing. The slide guitar adds an extra ounce of southern sound that is welcome. The mandolin on “Locust Street” 
adds to the beauty of this album superbly. 	The image of a sleepy bar in Austin comes to mind with the slow country waltz of “Oh Josephine.” Then the rock ‘n’ roll kicks in. 	“Wounded Bird” runs free like any good rock song should, reminiscent of the bands of old like Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith. As is usually the case with a first single, “Goodbye Daughters of the Revolution” is as mainstream as this album gets. 	Warpaint is an excellent example of why bands should go back to their roots instead of trying to reinvent rock music. The new album is just an extension of the homespun rock the Crowes have always done, going all the way back to “She Talks to Angels.” There is not one computer effect on this album, unlike 2001’s Lions and pretty much everything else released this year. 	CMT watchers and loyal Crowes’ fans will enjoy this album right off the bat, but the MTV/VH1 watchers might have to give this album a couple of tries. But since good old rock ‘n’ roll has been sparse in the mainstream, it’s definitely worth a listen.</div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Ohio University’s Housing Office is working to make room for male freshmen in the fall of 2008. Starting Fall Quarter, Treudley Hall, one of two female-only residence halls on campus, will allow male residents for the first time since its construction. The move is designed to make space for the growing male student population while keeping costs down.   	While it is true that a few Treudley residents are angered by this decision, the choice to make Treudley co-ed is a sound one. The building itself is ready to receive male residents, as it was constructed with men’s restrooms — the only cost that would be incurred in converting the dorm would be $50 for replacing the signs on the bathroom doors. When compared to more drastic methods of making space, such as converting the co-ed Ryors Hall to a male-only dorm, the choice to convert Treudley is far more reasonable. In addition, this decision is designed to serve the needs of the greater student population instead of the small minority of residents who desire all-female housing. Only 33 of the 1,057 incoming freshman who returned housing contracts specified single-sex housing as their top priority. There is no reason that a small group of malcontented residents should take precedence over the growing student population.	It seems ridiculous that some residents have reacted so strongly to this decision, especially when Voigt Hall on East Green will remain female-only next year. Those female students who live in Treudley and wish to stay in female-only housing will receive priority housing registration when rooms in Voigt are assigned. It is true that Voigt is located closer to Uptown and greek organizations’ houses, but these are not likely to have a significant effect on the quality of residents’ lives.	Some residents also have expressed concerns about sexual assault. Certainly, this is nothing to take lightly. But it is foolish to think that making Treudley co-ed will increase the incidence of rape or sexual assault. Simply having men living nearby will not make female residents any less safe.	Housing has done a commendable job of making sure that Treudley’s transition occurs smoothly. Even though some students have expressed grievances on the subject, it is clear that Treudley’s transition is needed. The male student population is growing. Converting Treudley is the most economical way to make room for the growing male population while being fair and respectful to current residents.</div></content>

I say reluctantly because I was confused about where and when to get on, and I did not like the picture of stepping into the stereotypical dirty, public bus. However, I was mistaken. 	Athens Transit is doing great work. First, they provide a wonderful service to those of us without a car by allowing us to go where we need.  I think it is impressive how the buses are on time, and how close (though it may not be realized) the stops are to wherever you are. Additionally, my driver was quite friendly, which made the trip enjoyable. 	I know many students may not take advantage of this great system because it seems intimidating to learn how it works, but it’s not confusing at all. I encourage my peers to go for a ride; times, routes and stops are available on their Web site: www.athenstransit.org.

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The e-mail sent to Ohio University students late Wednesday night from Chief Information Officer Brice Bible is misleading and, frankly, appalling.  	Let’s ignore for a minute that Bible’s e-mail questions the accuracy of a Post story simply by repeating claims he made in that story. Let’s also ignore for a minute that Bible sent out the e-mail late Wednesday — a cowardly move that made it nearly impossible for The Post to respond in the next day’s paper.	Let’s focus on the fact that Bible makes $210,000 a year, but it took a Post reporter (who makes $30 a week) to tell him that more than 25,000 student pictures were posted on an OU Web site without any sort of password or login protection.	But wait, you say, Bible’s e-mail claims the university “did not make student photos publicly available.” More specifically, the e-mail claims “to locate these files initially, a person would have to misuse authorized access to our network or gain information from someone else who misused authorized access.”	Bible is dead wrong, but what’s worse is that he knows it. He is apparently comfortable lying to every student at Ohio University.	All Post reporter David M. Hendricks Jr. did to access the photo directory was type in a Web address. He didn’t need any sort of login or password — just a keyboard and Firefox.	It’s true that Hendricks is a Resident Assistant, and the information he discovered was attached to a Web site used by RAs to file incident reports. That Web site was password protected; the picture directory that Hendricks discovered was not.	So how did he get there? He simply guessed strings of words at the end of the incident-reporting Web site and stumbled upon the picture directory — no password necessary. 	Bible makes a valid point when he says not everybody knows about the RA incident-reporting site. The site was not indexed by any search engine. 	But former RAs who used the site or even friends of RAs who saw the site would know the Web address. Is it really unfathomable that they might try to find offshoots of it by playing with the address? Heck, even somebody who was technologically savvy might have been able to discover the site and do the same thing Hendricks did. 	In an interview, Bible told me he couldn’t envision anyone guessing the way Hendricks did. But Jeff Schiller, a network manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was given specific information about how Hendricks discovered the pictures, said adding or removing characters from a Web address is common practice for those trying to find quasi-hidden information. And he went even further, saying OU had “no excuse for leaving such information exposed on a Web site, even one that isn’t advertised anywhere, without requiring some level of login.”	Schiller obviously isn’t familiar with OU because officials here are full of excuses. Instead of responding to our story by saying, “Yes, it’s true, but the problem was minor and we fixed it,” they’ve responded by trashing The Post’s story with vague claims that it is “misleading” and “troubling.”	One can certainly debate the significance of 25,000 student photos being posted online in this manner, even if it might be a violation of federal privacy law. Hendricks personally showed me my photo on the Web site; I thought it was rather comical.	What isn’t comical is Bible using the university e-mail system as his bully pulpit to spread lies about The Post. We stand by every word in that story, and we find it not troubling, but appalling, that high-ranking officials would question it simply to save themselves from personal embarrassment.

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Whenever I have a column to write, I know when I have my geography-major friend (he specializes in environmental hazards and sustainable communities) proofread it that it’s probably going to get torn to shreds. After it is published each Friday, I am fairly confident my chemistry-major friend is going to point out what is inaccurate scientifically. I’m also positive that each week my ISE-major friend will be mad he isn’t the centerpiece of my column, but that’s beside the point.       	The problem I continually have is that I look at the environment from a journalistic standpoint. I look at what’s in the newspapers, I form an opinion with those data and I write my column each week. I’ll admit that science has never been my strong suit, and until recently I figured I could swing by as an environmentalist without really grasping the nuts and bolts of the scientific facts. 	While I am deathly afraid of science and math classes and was excited to avoid them during college, I’ve finally come to the realization that science is the foundation of the environmental movement. John Coleman, the founder of The Weather Channel, derided Al Gore on Tuesday morning’s episode of “Fox and Friends” on Fox News Channel because he said the science doesn’t provide evidence that carbon is the culprit behind climate change. He mentioned that environmentalists needed to embrace and listen to science more, which is a statement I can agree with. 	Coleman was a speaker at the International Conference on Climate Change in New York, which ended last Tuesday. The conference was comprised of scientists and professors who are not in total agreement about with the mainstream Al Gorean theories of “global warming.” Business &amp; Media Institute actually noted that most mainstream news mocked the conference and the skeptics who questioned the “consensus” about climate change and its causes. 	Journalists tend to be stubborn, a character trait that can be both dangerous and rewarding in a field where everyone has a different story to tell and a different set of facts and figures to go with them. We must weed through sources, statistics and articles to find what is accurate and what is not. I think what journalists also need to do is start diving into the difficult theories and try to understand them. Don’t just talk to environmental organizations; talk to geologists, chemists and geographers. 	The same goes for environmentalists who don’t investigate more than news articles as sources for their facts and figures. I am one of those people who find it easier to wade through Grist and other popular Web sites without trying to wade through academic journals and magazines. I look at the political and ethical sides to issues without trying to understand the scientific underbelly of them. 	I’ve made the decision to take a step into the scientific realm, even though it could mean a lot of confusion, a lower GPA and tons of numbers. I’m starting off slow with environmental geography, but I’m working my way up so that I can hold a decent conversation about the environment without turning to stone at the mention of science. 	While there needs to be an understanding of both the political and scientific aspects of the environmental movement, I think the political side gets a lot more of the spotlight than the scientists who are expected to invent the renewable fuel sources, the alternative energy sources and chemical compounds for everyday activities like doing laundry that aren’t threatening to our health. 	This is an example of why you have to take sociology if you’re a biology major or physics if you’re an art major. To understand everything in this world, you can’t simply focus on what comes easily to you and disregard everything else. The world is a complex place, and the more tools you are equipped with to face it, the better. 	If the political and scientific sides of the environmental movement would be more united, we could get a lot more done in terms of energy efficiency and sustainability. A communication and an understanding need to be reached to some extent between the two, and right now that isn’t happening, and it’s detrimental to the goals of both parties.	People are still going to bicker, my column is still going to probably need proofreading and constructive criticism from both my science-loving friends, but I can’t deny the intersection between politics and science anymore. I’ve received far too many e-mails correcting my lack of scientific knowledge to deny that knowing more about science would make me a better writer and environmentalist to the people who take what I write as a columnist to be accurate news. I encourage anyone else guilty of my same crime to make an effort to bridge that divide, too.	Cathy Wilson is a junior journalism major. Send her an e-mail at cw224805@ohiou.edu. </div></content>

				<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> It’s widely believed within OU’s greek community that the McDavis administration has been unfriendly toward fraternities and sororities. Many are concerned that the Department of Campus Life is micromanaging important aspects of greek life through the various organizations responsible for governing fraternities and sororities. One wonders, then, why so many greeks are supportive of the current Student Senate. Over the course of this year, senators have done nothing to demonstrate that the concerns of the greek community are important to them, and this should lead their greek supporters to question the wisdom of continuing that support.  	What could Student Senate have done differently? For starters, senators could have used their bully pulpit as the voice of the student body to urge Campus Life to ease its stranglehold on the greek community. As noted in this column earlier in the quarter, many fraternity brothers are concerned about plans by the Interfraternity Council (IFC) to phase out the more favored informal recruitment process and replace it with an unpopular formal process governed by IFC. Why hasn’t Student Senate passed a resolution addressing these concerns? Shouldn’t senators have spoken up in defense of the greek community’s right to govern its own recruitment processes?	Of course, it’s possible that Student Senate is unaware of these concerns. If this is the case, it raises another problem: Are senators even hearing the complaints of the greek community? If greek concerns aren’t being heard on Student Senate, this problem could be easily remedied by establishing a Commission on Greek Life. Student Senate commissions exist to ensure that important or underrepresented groups have a voice in student government. The greek community is both important and underrepresented, but it is currently under the umbrella of the Commission on University Life. This commission already deals with a wide range of issues that make it impossible for it to address the multitude of issues important to the greek community. If Student Senate wants to adequately represent the greek community, fraternities and sororities should have their own Student Senate commission.	According to the Department of Campus Life Web site, 12 percent of the undergraduate student population belongs to a fraternity or sorority. Clearly the greek community deserves to be adequately represented in student government, and any Student Senate that is serious about representing the student body will seek to address greek concerns. Unfortunately, the current Student Senate has proven all year that it either cannot or will not meet student needs, and the needs of the greek community have been no exception. As Spring Quarter approaches and with it the promise of new Student Senate elections, senators seeking reelection will once again be looking for support from fraternities and sororities. The greek community may want to think long and hard before granting them any more support. Whoever their opposition may be, they would certainly be hard pressed to do a worse job addressing the issues important to the greek community.
